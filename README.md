## Overriding Theme i18n Keys

If you need to customize certain translation keys without modifying theme files, you can override the theme's i18n keys at the site level. Simply create an `i18n` folder in your site‚Äôs root directory and add the keys you want to override there.

To override `sitename`, `siteslogan`, `siteseokeywords` and `siteseodescription` from the theme‚Äôs i18n file, follow these steps:

1. In your site‚Äôs root directory, create an `i18n` folder if it doesn‚Äôt already exist.
2. Inside the `i18n` folder, create the appropriate language file (e.g., `en.toml`).
3. Add the following content to override the theme's i18n keys:

```shell

   # File path: i18n/en.toml
   [sitename]
   other = "Site Name"

   [siteslogan]
   other = "Site Slogan"

   [siteseokeywords]
   other = "Site Home SEO Keywords"

   [siteseodescription]
   other = "Site Home SEO Description"
   
```

## Customizing the Theme by Editing Source Code

If you plan to modify this theme, note that it is built with TailwindCSS. Before making changes, ensure you initialize TailwindCSS in your project and follow the setup instructions to properly configure your development environment.

```shell

cd themes/Niello

# Run the command to install Tailwind CSS
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli

# Run the command to build and watch for updates
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i assets/css/main.css -o assets/css/app.css --minify --watch

```

---

## Google Adsense & Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

Niello supports Google AdSense by configuring the googleadclient parameter in the [params] block and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) by setting the ga parameter in the hugo.toml file(previously config.toml), as shown above.

---

## Search

To enable the search functionality, you need to configure JSON output in the hugo.toml file by adding the following:

```shell
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "JSON"]
```

And a search folder with an _index.md file under the content directory is required, for example: content/en/search/_index.md

+++

title = "Search Results"  
date = 2024-12-13T15:00:00+08:00  
draft = false  
layout = "search"  

+++

With this setup, the search URL will be /en/search/?q=keywords

---

## Archives(Options)

To enable the archives functionality, you need to manually add an archives.md file to the content root directory:

```shell
|--- content
|-------| archives.md
```

or multilingual exampl:

```shell
|--- content
|-------| en	
|----------| archives.md # English
|-------| zh	
|----------| archives.md # Chinese
```
The content should be as follows:

```shell
+++
title = 'Archives'
date = 2024-10-25T09:16:03+08:00
draft = false
categories = ["archives"]
layout = "archives"
+++

```

---

## Ignore Posts(Options)

To exclude posts like cookie.md, privacy.md, and terms.md, configure the site parameters as follows:

```shell
[params]
[params.ignore]
	categories = ["privacy", "terms", "archives", "cookie"]
```
The content structure is as follows, and posts to be ignored must have categories specified in their front matter.

```shell	
|---content/en
	    |---cookie.md
	    |---privacy.md
	    |---terms.md
	    |
	    |---/example1
			|---example1-1.md
			|---example1-2.md
	    |---/example2
			|---example2-1.md
			|---example2-2.md
			|---example2-3.md
|---content/fr
|---content/zh

```
